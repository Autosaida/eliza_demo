{
  "overview": "Jupiter (JUP) is experiencing a notable upward trend with a 12.70% increase in the last 24 hours, supported by significant trading volumes. However, the sell transactions slightly outnumber the buys across various timeframes, indicating mixed market sentiment. Liquidity is strong at $1,643,414.85, suggesting the ability to handle large trades without significant price impact. The market cap and FDV indicate that the token is relatively established.",
  "recommendation": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 70,
  "reasoning": "The token has shown positive price momentum and strong liquidity, which are promising signs. However, the slightly higher number of sell transactions compared to buys suggests some caution. Holding is recommended to see if the upward trend continues or if a correction occurs.",
  "risks": [
    "Potential for a short-term price correction after recent gains",
    "Slightly higher sell transactions could indicate profit-taking",
    "Market volatility could affect token price"
  ],
  "opportunities": [
    "Continued upward price momentum could lead to further gains",
    "Strong liquidity supports large trades and market stability",
    "Positive market sentiment could attract more investors"
  ]

### 4. Simulated Trade 1 - Buy UNI

**User Input:**
```text
0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984
```

**Bot Response:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984",
  "symbol": "UNI",
  "priceUsd": 5.88,
  "action": "BUY",
  "amount": 1000,
  "reasoning": "The UNI token has shown a positive price change over the last 24 hours (3.05%) and a significant trading volume, indicating strong market interest. The liquidity is high, which suggests that a buy order can be executed without significant slippage. Diversifying the portfolio by buying UNI could capitalize on the upward trend and potential further price appreciation. However, only a portion of the WETH holdings is used to avoid going all-in, maintaining a balanced risk approach."
}

```

**Bot Response:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca",
  "symbol": "LINK",
  "priceUsd": 15.21,
  "action": "BUY",
  "amount": 300,
  "reasoning": "LINK has shown a positive price trend with a 5.93% increase over the last 24 hours and has a healthy volume and liquidity. The recent buy-to-sell ratio is favorable, indicating potential continued upward momentum. Investing a portion of the WETH holdings into LINK could capture further gains while maintaining portfolio diversification."

### 6. Simulated Trade 3 - Sell UNI

**User Input:**
```text
0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984
```

**Bot Response:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984",
  "symbol": "UNI",
  "priceUsd": 5.88,
  "action": "SELL",
  "amount": 500,
  "reasoning": "The recent price change for UNI shows an upward trend with a 3.11% increase in the last 24 hours. However, the sell transactions outnumber the buys in the last 24 hours, indicating potential resistance or profit-taking at current levels. To maximize ETH profits before any potential price correction, a partial sell of 500 UNI is recommended, capitalizing on current gains while maintaining exposure to further upside potential."
